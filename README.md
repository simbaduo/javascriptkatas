# Codekatas

![](images/katas.png)

This is a list of Code Katas (code logic challenges). This list was compiled during my development bootcamp from daily morning practice on coding challenge sites and occasional homework assignments. I modified external test samples to work in the Ava test runner in JavaScript. I have also created extra tests on my own to develop my skills and learn more about the testing process under the hood. 

There are 2 separate files function.test.js files in appropriate folders 

1) - Solutions : Passes all tests by displaying every kata solution in the file 

2) - Test : Forces the user to solve every kata starting with the first puzzle
