# Codekatas
This is a list of Code Katas (code logic challenges). This list was compiled during my development bootcamp from daily morning challenges on code wars and occasional homework assignments. I modified the test samples to work in the Ava test runner in JavaScript. I have also created extra tests on my own to develop my skills and learn more about the testing process under the hood. 

There are 2 separate files function.test.js files in appropriate folders 

1) - Test -   which forces the user to solve every kata starting with the first puzzle 

and 

2) - Solutions - which passes every test by displaying all the solutions in the program.
